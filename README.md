# Camera-Paint
[![.Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7%20%7C%203.8-blue)]()
---
System that allows to paint images with use of camera.  
You can scan any object you want and use it as your pointer.  
You can use a lot of diffrent types of pencils, brushes and other graphic tools. 

## Motivation

## Features
Basic feature of the program is to map the motion captured by the camera onto the image. We have created several different tools with different effect for this purpose. In the current version of the project ther are five types of tools to choose from:
1. Painting tool
    * Brush
    * Pencil
    * Spray
2. Shapes
    * Empty square
    * Full circle
    * Empty circle
3. Fill
4. Pick color
5. Text

Some of these tools have configuration options like size or opacity.
Except these tool, we also offer other options that are typical for graphic editors (undo, redo, cut, copy, paste, clear, changing image size) and saving images in five types (PNG, JPEG, GIF, TIFF and BMP).

## Technology
Project is created in Python 3 and uses several libraries:
1. OpenCV - for camera and image operations
2. Tkinter - for graphical user interface
3. Other libraries listed in the file requirements.txt
